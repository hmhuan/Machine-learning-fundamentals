### Cross validations

The way to evaluate models.
- N-fold cross validation
- Leave-one-out cross validation (for small sample, small dataset)

### Confusion matrix

The size of matrix is depend on the number of things we would like to predict.

### Sensitivity and Specificity
- Precision is percentage of correctly predicted answers.
- Sensitivity is percentage of actual positives correctly predicted.
- On the other hand, specificity is percentage of actual negatives correctly predicted.

### Bias and Variance


### ROC and AUC
